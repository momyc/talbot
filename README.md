# Telegram bot backed by LLM

Originally this was a coding challenge I was given by some company that considered me for one of their positions. I decided to leave it here as a demonstration of my current skills to become productive with something completly new to me in pretty short time. I had no experiece with LLM related technology and it took me couple of days.

The challenge was about building a Telegram bot that can use different LLMs to support multiple Q/A conversations (with memory). LLMs as well as conversations are switchable at any time and LLM can be be augumented with Pinecone index.

It isn't a production grade project although I have a Telegram bot registered and I can start it at any time if anyone is interested in plying with it.
